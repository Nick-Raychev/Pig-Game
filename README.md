# Pig-Game
**Description**<br>
The Pig Game is a web-based implementation of the classic dice game "Pig". It allows players to take turns rolling a virtual six-sided die and accumulating points based on their rolls. The objective is to reach a certain score threshold (usually 100 points) before your opponent.

This project was developed as part of a Udemy course on game development. It serves as a demonstration of core web development concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as interactive user interfaces and game logic implementation.

Hold your score: Click the "Hold" button to end your turn and add your current points to your total score.
