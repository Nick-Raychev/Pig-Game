# Pig-Game
**Description**<br>
The Pig Game is a web-based implementation of the classic dice game "Pig". It allows players to take turns rolling a virtual six-sided die and accumulating points based on their rolls. This project was developed as part of a Udemy course on game development.<br>

**Objective**<br>
In the Pig Game, the primary goal is to reach **100** points before your opponent so you need to strategically decide when to "hold" your accumulated points before rolling a 1 on the dice. Rolling a 1 will result in losing all points accumulated during your turn. Therefore, effective risk management and decision-making are essential to maximize your score and outmaneuver your opponent.<br><br>

**Features**<br>
- Roll the die: Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the die and accumulate points.<br>
- Hold your score: Click the "Hold" button to end your turn and add your current points to your total score.<br>
- Win the game: The first player to reach the score threshold (usually 100 points) wins the game.<br>
